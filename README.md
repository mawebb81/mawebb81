# About me

**mawebb81/mawebb81** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a UC Engineer working for the UK Home Office. I mainly focus on Microsoft technologies but dabble in other areas. Have a lot of experience designing, implementing and maintaining voice and video services.

I enjoy scripting (mainly PowerShell) and automating maitenance tasks. I'm currently learning how to use Github more effectively as a means to better maintain and organise the scripts I use both for work and personal tasks.
